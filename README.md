# Simrig_simulation_Assetto_Corsa
This project is intended to collect data from Assetto Corsa and use it to provide force feedback in real world.
Clone the ls folder into the "SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\apps\python\" folder.
Run the game and start a race. V1.0.0 would stream rpms info to the local host.
